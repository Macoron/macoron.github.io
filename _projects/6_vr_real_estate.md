Project made by Interactive Lab.

This app was created as a VR showroom to address the main challenge faced by the real estate developer company: showcasing non-built apartments to potential customers. The key features of the app included:

- Synchronization with a projector to display walls of future apartments.
- A specialized app for controlling the presentation.
- Support for multiple users in the same virtual environment.

My main responsibilities were developing the user interface and implementing the synchronization logic for tracking. The project was successful and later expanded for three other real estate projects.
