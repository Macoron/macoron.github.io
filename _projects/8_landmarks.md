Project made by Sber AR/VR Lab. Using custom Visual Positioning System, our team created AR filters several city landmarks. One of the chalanges was to integrate Unity3d visualization in native mobile application writen in Swift and Kotlin. We decided to pack our project as a Library and integrate into existing app.

        {% include video.html path="assets/video/landmarks.mp4" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" controls=true %}
    </div>
</div>
