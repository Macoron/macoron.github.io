I have been studying at the university while also doing freelance work during my free time. After successfully completing several projects for Samberdino Game Studio, I was invited to join their company.

As a part of the team, we developed a mobile game called Boom Day, which was an MMORTS similar to Clash of Clans. My primary responsibilities included working on network architecture and AI logic. Additionally, I had the opportunity to lead junior developers who were responsible for developing various unit mechanics.

After completing the project, I left the company to focus more on my graduation work. I am truly grateful for the chance to work with highly experienced developers and lead a small team this early in my career.
