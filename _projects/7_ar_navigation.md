Project made by Sber AR/VR Lab. 

Our lab was located in a maze-like office building, so our team decided to develop an AR Navigation app to make navigation easier. Using a custom Visual Positioning System, we created a mobile app for iOS and Android. 

My responsibility was leading the technical team, working on app architecture, localization techniques, and protocols. Main challenge was to develope an app that works with complex custom computer vision pipeline, has fancy UI and supports several buildings.

The project expanded to three business centers and two shopping malls. Eventually, our team developed a SDK that allowed third-party developers to create their own AR Navigations for different locations.
