Project made by Sber AR/VR Lab. 

Using custom Visual Positioning System, our team created AR Navigation app for iOS and Android. Project was scalled to three buisness centers and two malls. 

In the end we developed SDK that could be used by third-party developers to create AR Navigations on their own locations.
