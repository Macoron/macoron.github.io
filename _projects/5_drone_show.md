Project made by Interactive Lab.

This project was a live drone show created for the opening of a basketball match. As the main developer, my role focused on the "virtual choreography."

Specifically, I worked on developing visualization and validation tools for the copters. These tools ensured that all flight programs created by CG artists were valid and will be correctly executed for the show. This tools were also used as a flight control panel during show.
