Unity3d bindings for the <a href="https://github.com/nomic-ai/gpt4all">gpt4all</a>. It provides high-performance inference of large language models (LLM) running on your local machine.

Here is a small demo of running gpt4all in Unity. In this demo you need to hack Jammo - a secret keeper robot. He is prompted to not reveal his password, so it took me 3 minutes to confuse him enough. Gpt4All is free, open-sourced and can be used in commercial projects. I also used <a href="https://github.com/Macoron/whisper.unity">Whisper</a> for speech recognition and <a href="https://github.com/mixandjam/AC-Dialogue">AC-Dialogue from Mix and Jam</a>.
