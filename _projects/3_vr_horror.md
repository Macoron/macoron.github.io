Project made by Interactive Lab.

In 2017, I joined Interactive Lab, where my first project involved developing VR arcade games for a federal chain of entertainment businesses. These arcades were typically located in malls, and the owners wanted a lightweight and easily deployable solution. To meet their needs, our team decided to use Samsung Gear VR and Antilatency Trackers.
