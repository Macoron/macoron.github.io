Project made by Sber AR/VR Lab.

The main goal of the project was to develop automatic speech animation for 3D characters. Over time, the project expanded to include audio speech generation, text responses, and speech recognition. The final service provided all the necessary tools for custom digital avatar creation.

As the lead developer, my primary responsibility was to create the service architecture, network protocols, and developer plugins for Unreal, Unity, Maya and Blender. Additionally, I worked on the facial motion capture pipeline to gather a dataset for training custom networks.

The service was made publicly available for other developers and integrated into various end-user solutions, such as virtual assistants.
