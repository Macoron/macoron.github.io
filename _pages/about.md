Welcome to my website! My name is Aleksandr Evgrasin.

I'm a senior developer experienced with fast prototype creation, scaling up prototypes and leading small research teams. I'm familiar with a wide range of <b>AR/VR</b> devices and technologies.

Throughout my career, I have worked on various <b>machine learning</b> tasks. Currently, I am very interested in Large Language Models like GPT, Speech to Text synthesis, Generative Content and Computer Vision applications.

In my free time, I actively contribute to  <b>open-source projects</b>. I also enjoy playing video games, traveling, running and bike riding.

My most common nickname is macoron.
